NirigeCoin is a litecoin fork intended to be used by the Nirige community which is spread across Matrix and Discord.
Also cause im incapable and idk how to code and failed trying to learn it several times I might hire someone to build this crypto for me along with wallet support for windows and linux and maybe a way to solo mine it before I manage to get it added to some pool
Also keep in mind I'm a europoor (and a 3rd world europoor to be precise) so don't expect me to bathe you in money if you get this working
The coin uses scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.

- 3 minute block targets
- subsidy halves in 1.25 million blocks (~7 years)
- 1 billion total coins
- 400 coins per block
- 2016 blocks to retarget difficulty (idk what this is so it's the only LTC thing I left untouched)
